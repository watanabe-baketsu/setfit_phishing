                <p>A marketplace is a platform where vendors can come together to sell their products or services to a curated customer base. The role of a marketplace owner is to bring together the right vendors and the right customers to drive sales through
                    an exceptional multi-vendor platform - sellers have a place to gain visibility and sell their products, and the marketplace owner earns a commission from each sale. An online store, on the other hand, is a single store selling its
                    own products online. All marketing and operations are managed by the company that owns the website and products. </p>
                <p>Marketplace owners do not own the inventory their platform sells, unlike online store owners. The marketplace owner, therefore, leaves the more operational side of the business to vendors while focusing mainly on promoting their marketplace
                    brand with a view to driving traffic to the platform and converting site views into sales. </p>
                <p>Examples for marketplaces are large companies with huge inventories like Amazon, Rakuten or eBay or niche platforms like Etsy (handmade crafts), Runnics (sportswear for running) or Shop.Surf (Surf &amp; Skate gear and fashion). In contrast,
                    an online store is just one single company, such as Zara, Apple or Nike, selling its own products online via its own online shop. .</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 aboutus-right">
                <p>To help businesses decide which model suits them best, we have taken a deep dive into some of the features of marketplaces that make them different from online stores, and that make them attractive for digital entrepreneurs. They allow
                    ease of inventory management (in fact, they require no stock being hold by the marketplace), they are more scalable and they allow marketplace managers to focus more on the end-user. Here is a more detailed overview: </p>
                <p>As a result, marketplace owners only need to make sure that their vendors are adhering to quality regulations and guidelines. Add to this the fact that SaaS marketplace solutions, like Shoperyâ€™s, provide state-of-the-art solutions for
                    inventory management, with affordable plans, means that marketplaces might be the easier, and more profitable, of the two models when it comes to managing sometimes large and varied inventories.</p>
                <p>Of course, none of that is to say that running a marketplace is easy. A lot of work goes into content curation and moderation. Creating a hyper-vertical marketplace, for example, that is focused on a specific niche takes a lot of work
                    from the marketplace owner in sourcing sellers and including the right products. The effort pays off though. With so many vendors selling under one roof, marketplaces are a very interesting place for consumers to go to find cheaper
                    options and new alternatives. A marketplace, done well, can be a huge community of highly satisfied customers.</p>

            <p>When operating an online store, there is so much to think about: inventory management, site management, customer service, marketing, sales, social media, content and so much more. In contrast, when running a marketplace, the main focus is
                simply to offer the best platform for the users: marketplace vendors, and the customers they sell to. In particular, for entrepreneurs that leverage a state-of-the-art marketplace SaaS solution to take care of the technology side of the
                marketplace, there is a whole lot less on their plate. This means they can truly focus on adding value for their users and optimising the marketplace to best meet their needs.</p>
