I guess I expected some half-eaten sandwich or used dental floss, haha. Boy, was I wrong. You only asked me like a handful of questions and then you let me choose an e-Cigs kit?

But then I got to the end and got to select it and I thought, 'This is the greatest survey in the history of surveys!' Seriously though, I don't know how the data you collect helps you, or how you can afford to offer such great products, but I'm happy to take them off your hands.

I was genuinely impressed with the offers as well. When I've seen other surveys on ecommerce sites they usually offer trinkets. These are real products.</p>
