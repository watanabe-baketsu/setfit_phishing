<h1 id="welcometofreedesktop.org">Welcome to freedesktop.org</h1>

<p>freedesktop.org hosts the development of free and open source software, focused on interoperability and shared technology for open-source graphical and desktop systems. We do not ourselves produce a desktop, but we aim to help others to do so.</p>

<p>Our loose community of projects mostly produce <a href="./Software/">software</a> and/or <a href="./Specifications/">specifications</a>.</p>

<h2 id="softwareprojects">Software projects</h2>

<p>Most of our member projects produce software to be used as libraries or services. A full list is available at <a href="./Software/">our software page</a>.</p>

<p>Much of the software we host is focused on drivers and middleware for graphics and media devices, inter-process communication and authorization, input and internationalization.</p>

<p>All the software on freedesktop.org is available as open source and open to community contribution. The <a href="./Software/">software page</a> explains how to report bugs and propose changes to each of these projects.</p>

<h2 id="specifications">Specifications</h2>

<p>We also host discussion and development of specifications for interoperability. A full list is available at <a href="./Specifications/">our specifications page</a>.</p>

<p>These specifications mostly cover low-level desktop issues, such as identifying file types, launching applications, and exchanging data between applications and desktops. They are often called 'XDG' specifications, as an acronym for the <em>Cross-Desktop Group</em>.</p>

<p>freedesktop.org is not a formal standards body, and is not in itself a platform; we do not have a compliance test nor a certification. Anyone is free to use and implement the specifications on this site; the <a href="./Specifications/">specifications page</a> explains how to propose changes and existing specifications, or entirely new specifications.</p>

<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>

<p>The infrastructure we use to provide these services to our projects is documented on <a href="./Infrastructure/">our infrastructure page</a>. You can quickly get access to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org">our GitLab instance</a> where most of our code lives, <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org">our mailing lists</a>, or browse these wiki pages further to find out more.</p>

<h2 id="gettinginvolved">Getting Involved</h2>

<p>We welcome all new contributors, whatever your skill set, and aim to be a place you can learn and grow as an open-source contributor.</p>

<p>The first point of entry is to find the project you would like to work on, usually through our <a href="./Software/">software</a> or <a href="./Specifications/">specifications</a> page. Each project should have a clear link of how to report issues, discuss changes, and contribute back - this will almost certainly be on that project's page on <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org">our GitLab instance</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to create a new freedesktop.org project, or request hosting of an existing project you would like to move here, please see <a href="./NewProject/">the new project page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>freedesktop.org has adopted the Contributor Covenant for all the services we host. Please conduct yourself in an appropriate manner, avoiding abusive, bullying, and/or discriminatory behaviour. For more information, including where to report any inappropriate behaviour, please consult the full <a href="./CodeOfConduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h2 id="privacyandpersonalinformation">Privacy and personal information</h2>

<p>When you use freedesktop.org services, you might disclose personally-identifying information to us. Our <a href="./PrivacyPolicy/">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect and use this data.</p>

<h2 id="contactus">Contact us</h2>

<p>If you have questions about the site itself or our infrastructure, the administrators can be reached on the <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/sitewranglers">sitewranglers list</a>, or also on OFTC's #freedesktop IRC channel. Platform-wide announcements and discussions are generally on the <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/freedesktop">freedesktop mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that it may take some time to answer your question on IRC, and we are also unlikely to be able to help with project-specific issues (e.g. 'why does ModemManager crash?'). Questions or issues with a specific member project should be directed to that project's own mailing list or bug tracker.</p>

<h2 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h2>

<p>freedesktop.org is a completely volunteer organisation with no corporate backing or funding stream. We are part of the <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/XorgFoundation/">X.org Foundation</a>, which is a member project of <a href="https://www.spi-inc.org">Software in the Public Interest, Inc.</a>, for the purposes of holding assets.</p>

<p>We would like thank <a href="https://metal.equinix.com">Equinix Metal</a> and <a href="https://www.pdx.edu">Portland State University</a> for their generous support of the infrastructure required to host freedesktop.org. We are also grateful to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://opensource.google">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.intel.com">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.hp.com">HP</a> for previously sponsoring some of our servers. These kind donations have made it possible for us to run the services we do.</p>
