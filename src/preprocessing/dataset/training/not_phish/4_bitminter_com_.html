Bitminter was a Bitcoin mining pool.
Roughly 1% of the bitcoins in circulation came from Bitminter.
In the beginning mining was difficult. Bitminter wanted to give people
an easier introduction to Bitcoin and mining. That mission has been fulfilled.
Thank you to everyone who mined with us over the years.
We hope you enjoyed it and that you are still part of
the cryptocurrency community.
<br><br>
Best wishes for the future from <a href="mailto:support@bitminter.com">support@bitminter.com</a>

in big miners were unsuccessful</p>
<p>2019-08-12: Last Bitcoin block (<a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/00000000000000000015ebd78a3c6ff38f42c6424f96eaa80d96ddbe7134676b">#589801</a>) mined by Bitminter</p>

<p>2014: Small ASIC miners that connect to a PC's USB-port could no longer compete with the big stand-alone ASIC miners. This made the Bitminter (PC) client software obsolete, but Bitminter went on as a mining pool.</p>
<p>2013-08-27: Bitminter reached 100&nbsp;000 users</p>
<p>2013-05: Peak mining activity; approx. 10% of the world's Bitcoin hashpower
was mining with Bitminter, sometimes producing up to 20% of the daily blocks and bitcoins
</p><p>2013-01: The first ASIC mining machines began shipping to customers. During 2013 support for a few models was added to the Bitminter client software.</p>
<p>2012-11-28: First Bitcoin halving, reducing block reward from 50 to 25 BTC</p>
<p>2012-09-11: Bitminter reached 10&nbsp;000 users</p>
<p>2012: During 2012 some FPGA mining machines were sold commercially. Support for a few models was added to the Bitminter client software.</p>
<p>2011-11-07: Bitminter began sending all mining income to address <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/19PkHafEN18mquJ9ChwZt5YEFoCdPP5vYB">19PkHafEN18mquJ9ChwZt5YEFoCdPP5vYB</a> - 57 blocks were mined with individual addresses prior to this
</p><p>2011-11-04: Merged mining of namecoin (NMC) started</p>
<p>2011-10-24: Bitminter reached 1000 users</p>
<p>2011-07-20: Bitminter reached 100 users</p>
<p>2011-07-03: First Bitcoin block (<a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/00000000000000241123ba5f49ec423ad3e3a380abe9e4a1fcd699dee8f577da">#134500</a>) mined by Bitminter</p>
<p>2011-06-26: Bitminter launched; the user-friendly alternative with
easy-to-use mining software for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
</p><p>2011-03: Development of the Bitminter software began. Mining was technically difficult in the early days. A text-based mining client had to be run from the command line. Most people didn't know what a command line was. The original idea for Bitminter was for an easy-to-use graphical mining client that anyone could use. This was for mining on graphics cards initially. As client development neared completion the project turned into a full mining pool instead of just the client.</p>
