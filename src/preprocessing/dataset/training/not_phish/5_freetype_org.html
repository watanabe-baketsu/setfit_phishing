<h4>FreeType 2.11.0</h4>
<div class="date">2021-07-19</div>
<p>Our new release brings an additional rendering module to
create Signed Distance Fields (SDF) for glyphs; it also
introduces an experimental interface to access
<a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec/">‘COLR’&nbsp;v1</a>
fonts.
</p><p>As usual, there are many more fixes and features; please
see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.11.0/">here</a>
for more.</p>
<h4>FreeType moved to freedesktop.org</h4>
<div class="date">2021-01-16</div>
<p>We are now using the infrastructure of
the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype">gitlab
instance of freedesktop.org</a>. All bug issues have been
imported (kudos to Anurag Thakur for doing this tedious
job!), together with the git repositories, which have been
renamed
to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype">freetype</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype-demos">freetype-demos</a>
(this is, we are dropping the&nbsp;‘2’ in the
repository names).</p>
<p>The git repositories
at <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/freetype/">Savannah</a>
will stay as mirrors.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.10.4</h4>
<div class="date">2020-10-20</div>
<p>This is an emergency release, fixing a severe
vulnerability in embedded PNG bitmap handling
(see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.4/">here</a>
for more).</p>
<p class="warning">All users should update immediately.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.10.3</h4>
<div class="date">2020-10-10</div>
<p>This is a maintenance release, having better support for
TrueType glyphs with overlapping contours. See
the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.3/">list
of changes</a> for more details.</p>
<p>A warning for distribution maintainers: Version 2.10.3
and later may break the build of ghostscript, due to
ghostscript's <a href="https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=702985">use
of a withdrawn macro</a> that wasn't intended for external
usage. A fix is
available <a href="https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=41ef9a0bc36b">here</a>.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.10.2</h4>
<div class="date">2020-05-09</div>
<p>Besides various maintenance fixes, this release comes
with support
of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/">WOFF&nbsp;2
fonts</a>. More details are listed in
the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.2/">list
of changes</a>.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.10.1</h4>
<div class="date">2019-07-01</div>
<p>A new maintenance release, fixing bytecode hinting of
OpenType variation fonts and cmap processing of PCF fonts,
among other things. Check
the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.1/">list
of changes</a> for more fixes.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.10.0</h4>
<div class="date">2019-03-15</div>
<p>This release brings one notable feature, namely support
for color-layered outline glyphs (for example, scalable
emoji glyphs). Additionally, the API reference has been
completely overhauled and modernized, as already
announced.</p>
<p>As usual, many minor fixes and corrections have been
applied also; a detailed list is
given <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.0/">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Website Makeover</h4>
<div class="date">2018-08-25</div>
<p>A revamped version of the FreeType website is available
for preview <a href="https://nikramakrishnan.github.io/freetype-web-jekyll">here</a>.
It includes a complete interface redesign, and uses
markdown as input which greatly improves maintainability.
Comments are welcome.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.9.1</h4>
<div class="date">2018-05-02</div>
<p>This is a maintenance release; most importantly fixing
correct handling of Type&nbsp;1 fonts with flex features,
which was broken in version 2.9. An overview of the
remaining changes is
given <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.9.1/">here</a>.
All users should upgrade.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.9</h4>
<div class="date">2018-01-08</div>
<p>FreeType version 2.9, the first release of a new
‘minor’ series, is now available for download.
The main reason for starting a new series is Ewald Hew's
GSoC contribution of making Adobe's CFF engine handle
Type&nbsp;1 fonts also, greatly improving the rendering
quality of this ancient but still important font
format.</p>
<p>If you are going to use variation fonts, please update to
this version since it comes with some important fixes.
More information on this and other changes can be
found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.9/">here</a>.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.8.1</h4>
<div class="date">2017-09-16</div>
<p>FreeType 2.8.1 has been released. This is mainly a
maintenance release with one important change: By default,
FreeType now offers high quality LCD-optimized output
without resorting to ClearType techniques of resolution
tripling and filtering. In this method,
called <em>Harmony</em>, each color channel is generated
separately after shifting the glyph outline, capitalizing
on the fact that the color grids on LCD panels are shifted
by a third of a pixel. This output is indistinguishable
from ClearType with a light 3-tap filter.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.8.1/">here</a>
for a extensive list of changes; noteworthy bug fixes are
correct handling of B/W TrueType hinting and some OpenType
variation font handling issues.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.8</h4>
<div class="date">2017-05-13</div>
<p>FreeType 2.8 has been released. CFF2 support and
OpenType variation font handling is now complete; the
auto-hinter now understands 25 more scripts, for example
N'Ko and Tifinagh.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.8/">here</a>
for a list of changes; noteworthy bug fixes are the
handling of TrueType fonts: unhinted loading didn't work
as expected, and the light auto-hinter used incorrect
metrics.</p>
<h4>GSoC</h4>
<div class="date">2017-02-28</div>
<p>The FreeType project was accepted to be part
of <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google
Summer of Code</a> 2017! Here's <a href="gsoc.html">a
link</a> to our ideas list – if you have another
one, please write to
our <a href="mailto:freetype-devel@nongnu.org">mailing
list</a> so that we can discuss your suggestions,
eventually adding them to the list. And if you want to
participate as a student, now is the time to discuss
everything, again using the mailing list.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.7.1</h4>
<div class="date">2016-12-30</div>
<p>FreeType 2.7.1 has been released. The most important
news is preliminary support of Adobe's new CFF2 font
format and variation fonts as specified in the new
OpenType specification version&nbsp;1.8. It also fixes
the handling of raw CID fonts (which might be found in PDF
files)</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.7.1/">here</a>
for a list of changes.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.7</h4>
<div class="date">2016-09-08</div>
<p>We start a new ‘minor’ series, which finally
allows us to activate a new default mode for bytecode
hinting (see also the announcements below for version
2.6.4 and 2.6.5): Subpixel hinting, also known as
ClearType hinting.</p>
<p>In case you are already using subpixel hinting (for
example, by using the ‘Infinality patches’ as
provided by some GNU/Linux or BSD distributions, or
directly
from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161213223431/https://bohoomil.com/">bohoomil.com</a>),
be noted that the new mode might provide subtle
differences; the code was simplified to make
it <em>much</em> faster. If you are used to the old
full-pixel hinting, you will see many rendering changes.
If you really dislike them, you can disable them at
compile time or using the
new <code>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</code> environment
variable.</p>
<p>A description of the remaining changes can be
found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.7/">here</a>,
as usual.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.6.5</h4>
<div class="date">2016-07-12</div>
<p>This release is almost identical to the previous version,
with two differences.
</p><ul>
<li>It compiles again on Mac OS X, and</li>
<li>it reverts the activation of subpixel hinting by
default; it will be enabled by default in the
forthcoming 2.7.x series. Main reason for reverting
this feature is the principle of least surprise: a
sudden change in appearance of all fonts (even if the
rendering improves for almost all recent fonts) should
not be expected in a new micro version of a
series.</li>
</ul>
<h4>FreeType 2.6.4</h4>
<div class="date">2016-07-05</div>
<p>FreeType 2.6.4 has been released. The most important
change is a new bytecode hinting mode for TrueType fonts
that finally activates subpixel hinting (a.k.a. ClearType
hinting) by default.</p>
<p>The new release also brings support for the following new
scripts in the auto-hinter: Armenian, Cherokee, Ethiopic,
Georgian, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Sinhala, and
Tamil.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.4/">here</a>
for a detailed list of changes.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.6.3</h4>
<div class="date">2016-02-09</div>
<p>FreeType 2.6.3 has been released. It brings support for
four new Asian scripts in the auto-hinter (Khmer, Myanmar,
Kannada, and Bengali), together with other, minor
improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.3/">here</a>
for a detailed list of changes.</p>
<h4>More on the 2.6.2 release for users and developers</h4>
<div class="date">2015-11-30</div>
<p>FreeType 2.6.2 ships with three interesting details for
users and developers of rendering libraries that deal with
text. <a href="freetype2/docs/hinting/text-rendering-general.html">Read
more</a>.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.6.2</h4>
<div class="date">2015-11-28</div>
<p>FreeType 2.6.2 has been released. This is a minor
release that mainly provides better handling of malformed
fonts. All users should upgrade.</p>
<p>A new feature is stem darkening support for the
auto-hinter. Note, however, that it is off by default,
since most graphic systems don't provide correct linear
alpha blending with gamma correction, which is crucial for
a good appearance. For the same reason, stem darkening
for the CFF engine is now off by default, too.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.2/">here</a>
for a more detailed list of changes.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.6.1</h4>
<div class="date">2015-10-04</div>
<p>FreeType 2.6.1 has been released. This is a minor
release that corrects problems with CFF metrics, and that
provides better handling of malformed fonts. Two notably
new features are auto-hinting support for the Lao script
and a simple interface for accessing named instances in GX
TrueType variation fonts.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.1/">here</a>
for a list of changes.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.6</h4>
<div class="date">2015-06-08</div>
<p>FreeType 2.6 has been released. This is a new major
release that provides a better (and simpler) thread-safety
model. Among other new features we now have auto-hinting
support for Arabic and Thai, together with much improved
handling of Apple's GX TrueType variation font format.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6/">here</a>
for a list of changes.</p>
<h5>Roadmap</h5>
<p>Besides user support and fixing bugs, your money will
help me implement the following issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a test framework for FreeType. This is a
huge, long-term undertaking that will ensure both
stability and reliability of the library. The idea is
to collect test cases (mainly broken fonts) that cover
as much source code as possible. Another idea to
investigate is the development of scripts that can
generate both valid and invalid input data to
systematically increase the coverage of executed library
code, including the unlikely cases. Finally, images of
valid, well-rendered input fonts could be collected: As
soon as a change to the rendering image gets applied, a
comparison run with those images should detect rendering
regressions.</li>
<li>Further improvements to the auto-hinter. Right now,
the module for Indic support is a dummy, and support for
the family of Arabic scripts is completely
missing. <span class="comment">[FreeType 2.9 comes with
auto-hinting support for almost all scripts where
hinting makes sense.]</span> Both investigation and
research is necessary to find out how much auto-hinting
is possible and useful, and whether other, completely
different scripts can be supported at all.</li>
<li>Right now, rendering Type&nbsp;1 and CID-keyed fonts
is the weakest part of FreeType. However, we now have a
brand-new module for handling CFF. Given that CFF is
very similar to Type&nbsp;1, it should be not too
difficult to use and/or extend the CFF code so that
Type&nbsp;1 fonts can be handled,
too. <span class="comment">[This was a GSoC project in
2017, and the resulting code has been merged into
FreeType 2.9.]</span></li>
<li>Explore whether it makes sense to merge FreeType with
(parts of)
the <a href="http://harfbuzz.org">HarfBuzz</a> library.
Since version 2.5.3, FreeType already links to HarfBuzz
to use its abilities for scanning OpenType layout
features, and more integration might be sensible for
both libraries.</li>
<li>More improvements to this website. Last year I’ve
redesigned the FreeType website. However, a large bunch
of documents are still using the old design, and some of
them are also no longer up to
date. <span class="comment">[As with version 2.6.0, the
FreeType Tutorial has been updated.]</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>FreeType 2.5.3</h4>
<div class="date">2014-03-08</div>
<p>FreeType 2.5.3 has been released. All users should
upgrade due to fixed vulnerability in the CFF driver
(CVE-2014-2240).</p>
<p>Its main new feature is much enhanced support of
auto-hinting SFNT fonts (i.e., TrueType and CFF fonts) due
to the use of
the <a href="http://harfbuzz.org">HarfBuzz</a> library. A
more detailed description of this and other changes can be
found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.3/">here</a>.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.5.2</h4>
<div class="date">2013-12-08</div>
<p>FreeType 2.5.2 has been released. It fixes a serious bug
introduced in version 2.5.1; all users should upgrade.</p>
<p>A listing of the changes can be
found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.2/">here</a>.</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.5.1</h4>
<div class="date">2013-11-25</div>
<p>FreeType 2.5.1 has been released, providing three major
new features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for the WOFF font format, contributed by
Behdad Esfahbod.</li>
<li>The auto-hinter now supports Hebrew, together with
improved support for Cyrillic and Greek.</li>
<li>The directory layout of the (installed) FreeType
header files has been simplified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among other changes I want to mention that FreeType's
TrueType debugger (<tt>ttdebug</tt>) has been made more
versatile. An exhaustive list of changes can be
found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.1/">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Pledgie Campaign Was Successful!</h4>
<div class="date">2013-06-25</div>
<p>Thanks to a very generous donation by Pierre Arnaud
from <a href="https://www.epsitec.ch">Epsitec</a>, the
pledgie campaign for FreeType has reached its goal. I
want to say thank you again to all donors! Of course,
noone stops you from further donating to the campaign
:-)</p>
<p>After integration of Adobe's CFF module and Google's
color emoji support, I will use the next months to work on
the remaining issues that I've promised to implement.
Stay tuned!</p>
<h4>FreeType 2.5</h4>
<div class="date">2013-06-19</div>
<p>FreeType 2.5 has been released. A major new feature is
support for color embedded bitmaps (eg. color emoji),
contributed by Behdad Esfahbod on behalf of Google.
Additionally, Adobe's CFF engine is now the default, which
makes a good reason to change from the 2.4.x to the 2.5.x
series.</p>
<p>On the technical side, the property API to access
FreeType module parameters (<tt>FT_Property_Set</tt>
and <tt>FT_Property_Get</tt>) is now declared as stable.</p>
<p>As usual,
see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.0/">this
file</a> for the complete release notes, which give more
details. And we have again blog entries
from <a href="https://blog.typekit.com/2013/06/19/adobe-cff-font-rasterizer-accepted-by-freetype/">Adobe</a>
and <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2013/06/youve-got-cff.html">Google</a>.</p>
<p>[Please download the 2.5.0.1 bundle of the FreeType
library, which fixes a packaging error.]</p>
