<p>Unfortunately after years of operation, the database behind hive-db.com was lost due to disk failure and isn't easily recoverable. It could be recreated using the chain itself and the <a href="https://github.com/aaroncox/steemdb">code on github</a>, I just don't have the time to do it at the moment. This site may come up again at some point in the future should time be found - otherwise feel free to use one of the <a href="https://hiveprojects.io/categories/block-explorers/">one of the block explorers listed here</a>.</p>
