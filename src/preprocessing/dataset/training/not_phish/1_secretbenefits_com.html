<h3>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>We'll never share your personal information with others except through the following circumstances:</p>

<ul class="list-spaced">
  <li>Third parties that are performing services on our behalf related to your account or use of this website. They will only have access to your information related to the service they are performing for us. They will not be able to share your personal information or use it for any reason other than the services they are contracted to perform for us.</li>

  <li>To defend against legal claims or to exercise our legal rights</li>
  <li>In connection with the sale of our business</li>

</ul>

<p>We may also use or share non-personal information or personal information that is in non-human readable form to improve our service or analyze the performance of our service.</p>

<p>We will always take any necessary and appropriate measures to protect your personal information from being accessed or disclosed inappropriately. But please always use caution when using this website or service and sharing any personal information online as we cannot guarantee your personal information, communications with other members, searches, or other information will always remain secure.</p>

<h3>Interest-Based Online Advertising and Google Analytics</h3>

<p>This section of our Privacy Notice provides details about interest-based online advertising (also called "targeted advertising", “remarketing”, or "behavioral advertising"), Google Analytics, and your choices with respect to this type of advertising.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics’ 3rd-party audience data such as age, gender and interests to better understanding the behavior of our customers and work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences. For example, you may see certain ads on this website or other websites because we contract with Google and other similar companies to target our ads based on information we or they have collected, including information that was collected through automated means (such as cookies and web beacons). These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>

<p>You may opt out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks for the purpose of delivering advertisements tailored to your interests, by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at <a href="https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/</a>. Because those opt-out and preference control pages are specific to the individual browser used to visit it, and because that page is not operated by Secret Benefits, we are unable to perform the opt-outs on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, <a href="/contact">please contact us here</a>.</p>
