<h2>What is Multiminer?</h2>
<p>MultiMiner is a cryptocurrency mining application available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<p>Its simple interface makes it easy to choose which cryptocurrency to mine by detecting the hardware you have available on your device. </p>
<p>MultiMiner supports mining with graphical processing units (GPUs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) circuits.</p>
<p>MultiMiner supports a range of mining algorithms, including but not limited to SHA256, Scrypt, CryptoNight, Ethash, Equihash, Pascal, Ethash, Keccak, Quark, Scrypt-Jane, and X11-15. This makes it possible to mine Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin, Zcash, and many more.</p>
<p>You can use MultiMiner's configurable strategies to automatically switch to mining the most profitable cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to make the decision manually, you can have MultiMiner alert you when there is a more profitable coin than the one you're currently mining. </p>
<p>It's also possible to connect MultiMiner with smartphone monitoring <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/software/">software</a> so you can check up on and control your mining rigs no matter where you are.</p>
<p>Advanced users will appreciate the ability to use a stratum proxy to point other miners to their network, effectively creating their own mining pool. </p>
<h2>Is MultiMiner Legit?</h2>
<p>MultiMiner also supports direct access to mining engine arguments and API settings. </p>
<p>It can automatically relaunch crashed miners and adjust mining intensity based on the time your computer has been idle. </p>
<p>These tools help make MultiMiner run smoothly in the background, with little ongoing input required.</p>
<p>While it's packed full of features, MultiMiner is very beginner friendly. First-time users will be greeted with a Getting Started wizard which walks you through the process of setting up your rigs and starting to mine. </p>
<p>The application updates itself automatically, meaning you should always have the most up to date version of MultiMiner and BFGMiner â€“ the underlying mining engine that powers MultiMiner. </p>
<p>There are also helpful tips that define some of the terms that will be unfamiliar to new miners.</p>
<p>MultiMiner is a very simple way to get started mining <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> and other cryptocurrencies. It can be set up to start mining automatically when you power on your computer, making it ideal for users who just want to set-and-forget. </p>
<p>Alternatively, power users can customize MultiMiner to run strategies and optimize their profits at all hours of the day and night, while monitoring their mining rigs remotely. </p>
<p>Overall, MultiMiner is a feature-rich and time-tested choice of cryptocurrency mining interfaces, with something to offer to users of all capabilities.</p>
