        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.out">a.out executable
format</a> dates back to the earliest days of Linux — and before.  It has
not been used in any serious way for decades, but support still exists in
the Linux kernel and has resisted all attempts at its removal.  Back in
January, Borislav Petkov <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220113160115.5375-1-bp@alien8.de/">tried yet
again</a> to delete support for this format, leading to another extended
discussion.  There is one difference this time around, though: the effort
to get rid of a.out support might just succeed.

        <p>
        A recent discussion on the python-ideas mailing list gives some insight
into how to—or how not to—propose a feature to be added to the language.  At first
blush, adding a method to Python's immutable <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html#tuples"><tt>tuple</tt></a>
type for replacing one of its elements is not a particularly strange idea,
nor one that would cause much in the way of backward-compatibility
concerns.  Even though there was some evidence offered that such a method might be
useful, it seems pretty unlikely that the idea will go anywhere, at least
in part because of the repetitive, bordering on aggressive, manner in which its
benefits were argued.

        Three candidates have thrown their hat into the ring as candidates for the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/vote/2022/vote_002">2022 Debian project
leader (DPL) election</a>.  One is Jonathan Carter, who is now in his
second term as DPL, while the other two are Felix Lechner and Hideki
Yamane.  As is the norm, the candidates self-nominated during the
nomination period and are now in the campaigning phase until April&nbsp;1.
The vote commences April&nbsp;2 and runs for two weeks; the results will be
announced shortly thereafter and the new DPL term will start on
April&nbsp;21.  The candidates have put out platforms and are fielding
questions from the voters, Debian developers, thus it seems like a good
time to look in on the election.

        At the conclusion of the 5.17 development cycle, 13038 non-merge
changesets had found their way into the mainline repository.  That is a
lower level of activity than was seen for 5.16 (14,190 changesets) but well
above 5.15 (12,337).  In other words, this was a fairly typical kernel
release.  That is true in terms of where the work that made up the release
came from as well.

        <p>
        The kernel community has a number of excuses for the relative paucity of
regression-test coverage in the project, some of which hold more water than
others.  One of the more convincing reasons is that a great deal of kernel
code is hardware-specific, and nobody can ever hope to put together a
testing system with even a small fraction of all the hardware that the
kernel supports.  A new driver-testing framework called <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220311162445.346685-1-vincent.whitchurch@axis.com/">roadtest</a>,
posted by Vincent Whitchurch, may make that excuse harder to sustain,
though, at least for certain kinds of hardware.

        CPU scheduling can be a challenging task; the scheduler must ensure that
every process gets a fair share of the available CPU time while, at the
same time, respecting CPU affinities, avoiding the migration of processes
away from their cached memory contents, and keeping all CPUs in the system
busy.  Even then, users can become grumpy if specific processes do not get
their CPU share quickly; from that comes years of debates over desktop
responsiveness, for example.  The <a href="/ml/linux-kernel/20220311161406.23497-1-vincent.guittot@linaro.org/">latency-nice
priority proposal</a> recently resurrected by Vincent Guittot aims to
provide a new tool to help latency-sensitive applications get their CPU
time more quickly.

        Python has often been touted as a "batteries included" language because of
its rich <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">standard library</a>
that provides access to numerous utility modules and is distributed with
the language itself.  But those libraries need maintenance, of course, and
that is provided by the Python core development team.  Over the years, it
has become clear that some of the modules are not really being maintained
any longer and they probably are not really needed by most Python
users—either because better alternatives exist or because they address
extremely niche use cases.  A long-running project to start the removal of those
modules has recently been approved.

        Disruptive changes are not much fun for anyone involved, though they may be
necessary at times.  Moving away from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1 hash function</a>, at
least for cryptographic purposes, is probably one of those necessary disruptive
changes.  There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">better
alternatives</a> to SHA-1, which has been "broken" 
from a cryptographic perspective for quite some time now, and most of the
software components that make up a distribution can be convinced to use
other hash functions.  But there are still numerous hurdles to overcome in
making that kind of a switch as a recent discussion on the Fedora devel
mailing list shows.

	Luckily for us, the race window contains the first few memory

<h2 class="Headline">Ekstrand:  How to write a Vulkan driver in 2022</h2>
        
        <div class="BlurbListing">
        <font size="-1">[Development] Posted Mar 24, 2022 21:23 UTC (Thu) by jake</font>
        <p>
        Over on the Collabora blog, Jason Ekstrand has a <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2022/03/23/how-to-write-vulkan-driver-in-2022/">detailed look</a> at writing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan">Vulkan</a> graphics driver in today's world. "<span>Not only has Vulkan grown, but Mesa has as well, and we've built up quite a suite of utilities and helpers for making writing Vulkan drivers easier.</span>"  The blog post takes the form of a tutorial of sorts, though the end result is not a functioning Vulkan driver,  the framework of one is shown.
</p><blockquote class="bq">
At the time we were developing ANV (the Intel Vulkan driver), the Vulkan spec itself was still under development and everything was constantly in flux. There were no best practices; there were barely even tools. Everyone working on Vulkan was making it up as they went because it was a totally new API. Most of the code we wrote was purpose-built for the Intel driver because there were no other Mesa drivers to share code. (Except for the short-lived LunarG Intel driver based in ilo, which we were replacing.) If we had tried to build abstractions, they could have gotten shot to pieces at any moment by a spec change. (We rewrote the descriptor set layout code from scratch at least five or six times before the driver ever shipped.) It was frustrating, exhausting, and a whole lot of fun.
<p>
These days, however, the Vulkan spec has been stable and shipping for six years, the tooling and testing situation is pretty solid, and there are six Vulkan drivers in the Mesa tree with more on the way. We've also built up a lot of common infrastructure. This is important both because it makes writing a Vulkan driver easier and because it lets us fix certain classes of annoying bugs in a common place instead of everyone copying and pasting those bugs.

<h2 class="Headline">Guidelines for research on the kernel community</h2>

        <p>
        As part of the response to last year's <a href="/Articles/854645/">UMN
fiasco</a>, Kees Cook and a group of collaborators have put together a set
of guidelines for researchers who are studying how the kernel-development
community (or any development community, really) works.  That document has
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/f09f6f9b6982">just been merged into
the mainline</a> as part 
of the 5.18 merge window.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote class="bq">
	This document seeks to clarify what the Linux kernel community
	considers acceptable and non-acceptable practices when conducting
	such research. At the very least, such research and related
	activities should follow standard research ethics rules.

        MIT Technology Review has <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/21/1047489/activists-are-targeting-russians-with-open-source-protestware">taken
a brief look</a> at open-source projects that have added changes protesting
the war in Ukraine and drawn some questionable conclusions:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote class="bq">
	No tech firm has gone that far, but around two dozen open-source
	software projects have been spotted adding code protesting the war,
	according to observers tracking the protestware
	movement. Open-source software is software that anyone can modify
	and inspect, making it more transparent—and, in this case at least,
	more open to sabotage.
