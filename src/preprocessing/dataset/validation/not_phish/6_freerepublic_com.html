      The ferry operator sacked 800 of its staff by video call today, replacing them with cheap agency workers Nigel Farage has slammed P&amp;O Ferries for making hundreds of staff redundant with immediate effect. Speaking on GB News, Nigel Farage said: "How are we going to protect British workers? Is this just the modern, globalised world that we live in? "This is one of the most cynical sackings I have ever seen in my life. "People who voted Brexit voted for better than this.

The victims' families talked about that pain in court Thursday, and also about the hatred they feel towards the shooter and the man they say is just as much to blame. Savannah Gonzalez didn't pull any verbal punches when she talked about Anthony Guzman. "I can't even express the hate we feel towards you," she said. "To say we hate you is actually an understatement." Her brother-in-law was 21-year-old Merehildo Luna. Police say Eddie Cordero gunned down...

      The war in Ukraine is making politicians and citizens think again about Finland’s signing of the Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty of 1997 to eliminate anti-personnel landmines by November 2011. The treaty aims to eliminate the production, stockpiling, storage and use of land mines worldwide. The decision to join the Ottawa Treaty caused controversy in 2011, but it was approved by parliament with 110 in favour and 47 against. The treaty’s strongest advocates were peace organisations and the then-president Tarja Halonen (SDP), while the defence ministry at the time disagreed. The land border between Finland and Russia is 1,300 kilometres long,...

      Three French nuclear missile submarines have been deployed at sea simultaneously for the first time in three decades as a response to Russian nuclear sabre-rattling. Two of France’s four Triomphant-class ballistic missile submarines have left their base at Ile Longue, south of Brest, bolstering the single vessel that is normally on permanent patrol under the Atlantic, according to the Telegramme, the newspaper of the Breton port. The last time three were deployed at once was in the decade before the end of the Cold War during a US-Soviet standoff over medium-range missiles in Europe.

      On Monday, US President Joe Biden raised some eyebrows when he stated that a “new world order” would be developed shortly, and it would be up to the US to spearhead it.Biden claimed the globe was at a “inflection point” that “occurs every three or four generations” and therefore it was up to the US to decide the result during an address at the Business Roundtable’s CEO Quarterly Meeting.“As one of the top military people said to me in a security meeting the other day, 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946, and since then we’ve established a liberal...

Former District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro’s office charged Honore in that case in June 2020, along with co-defendants Aaliyah Thompson (then 17) and Miguel Leon Jr. (then 17). Williams was sworn in...

      With severe shortage of food, cooking gas, and other essential items, sky-rocketing fuel prices and record-high inflation, Sri Lanka is battling its worst economic crisis in over several decades. A critical shortfall of foreign currency had led to a massive reduction in imports of essential items. This nightmarish situation has crippled the lives of common citizens who have been waiting in long queues across the country for groceries and fuel. At least two elderly men reportedly died in different parts of the country waiting for petrol and kerosene oil. As anger against the government grows, troops have been deployed outside...
