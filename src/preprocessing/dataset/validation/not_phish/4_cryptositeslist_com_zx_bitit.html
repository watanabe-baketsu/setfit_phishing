						<p>
							After knowing each other since we were kids, in 2014, us Bitit
							founders finished university and became obsessed with Bitcoin
							(but, like, REALLY obsessed). <br><br>We started to mine some
							in our tiny, still student-esque Parisian flats. There was lots of
							noise, lots of heat, lots of complexity. All we really wanted to
							do was grab a bunch of Bitcoin easily, to be part of the culture.
							Was that too much to ask? <br><br>Well, back then, yes.
							Because no platform in 2014 provided an easy way to buy Bitcoin.
							NOBODY. There were a few crappy websites that you wouldn’t want to
							get close to even by tapping on your keyboard with a wooden stick
							(and, OK, there was Coinbase gaining traction, but it was still
							pretty early).<br><br>So in 2015 we started Bitit to allow
							everyone, even those in the most remote areas of the world, to
							access the leading crypto assets seamlessly, to give them the
							tools that protect and manage their financial wellbeing.<br><br>The
							goal was simple: whether you’re an expert or just beginning, we’d
							push every day to make Bitit simple and intuitive, no headaches.
							We were solving one problem, accessibility.<br><br>And in 6
							years of activity, we created a platform that lets you go from KYC
							to Purchase to Token Delivery with essentially zero friction.<br><br>Bitit
							became one of France’s leading fiat-to-crypto platforms and served
							over half a million customers since its founding back in 2015.<br><br>And
							we did it all with just €5000 in initial capital and no marketing,
							just word of mouth. We didn’t raise big amounts of money, we just
							stayed resilient and tried to nurture the company each day.<br><br>We
							fought to build a product that worked for you, with no
							compromises. And damn, it was worth the fight! It was a crazy
							ride, 6 years of a continuous roller coaster, 6 years of falling
							and recovering, 6 years of resilience.<br><br>It really was an
							incredible journey, including for the 12 people who joined the
							team over the years. But we’re a startup - and in startups, sh*t
							happens.<br><br>Our team put in a tremendous amount of effort
							to avoid this situation, and despite rising interest in
							cryptocurrencies over the past years, interest which was then
							accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis, our team ran up against
							operational issues. We also faced multiple delays from our local
							French regulator that would have clarified our regulatory status,
							which is a huge deal when you’re operating in an extremely
							competitive environment requiring fast action. We’ve always been a
							small company that relied on agility and responsiveness, and we
							simply don’t have the resources to survive what became an extended
							period of uncertainty. These issues forced us to make the
							difficult decision to close the company down, effective today,
							April 15, 2021.<br><br>And so now we are all moving on to new
							adventures. We went from broke students coming out of nowhere to
							being grown adults who stayed true to our original ambition. We’re
							proud of the products we’ve built, products that enabled hundreds
							of thousands of customers to access financial freedom. The only
							regret is that the problem we were trying to solve is still
							enormous today.<br><br>We want to thank you, our customers,
							for all the support you’ve given us along the way. We also want to
							thank our employees, investors and financial partners who trusted
							us from the beginning.<br><br>We share a focus on building
							products that enable consumers to significantly improve their
							financial lives, and are honored to have been a small part of your
							journey.<br><br>To the moon,<br><br>Nicolas, Ugo, Simon
							and the Bitit Team
