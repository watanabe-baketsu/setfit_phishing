    <h3>Intro</h3>
    Welcome to this momentary pit stop on the road to finding what you need
    concerning <em>gzip</em>!
    <p>
    <em>gzip</em> is a single-file/stream lossless data compression
    utility, where the resulting compressed file generally has the suffix
    <code>.gz</code>.
    <br>
    <em>gzip</em> also refers to the associated compressed data format
    used by the utility.

    <h3>A Brief History</h3>
    Back when
    <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/woolly-mammoths-walk/">
    woolly mammoths</a> roamed the Earth,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-loup_Gailly">Jean-loup Gailly</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Adler">Mark Adler</a> wrote
    the <em>gzip</em> utility to replace the Unix <em>compress</em> utility. At
    the time the continued use of <em>compress</em> was threatened by giant
    corporations holding patents on the LZW algorithm used by
    <em>compress</em>. In addition to avoiding patent infringement,
    <em>gzip</em> provided superior compression. The <em>gzip</em> utility and
    format remain in wide use, these many eons later.
